# Password-Strength-Checker

The Password Strength Checker is a cybersecurity-focused Python project that analyzes and rates the strength of user-entered passwords.
It evaluates password complexity based on various parameters such as:  
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>Length</li>
  <li>Presence of uppercase and lowercase letters</li>
  <li>Numbers</li>
  <li>Special characters</li>
  <li>And checks against a list of commonly used password</li>
</ul>

This tool helps users create secure passwords and understand how attackers exploit weak ones.

# Objective
The main objective of this project is to:
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>Educate users about password security</li>
  <li>Automatically evaluate password strength</li>
  <li>Warn users if the password is weak or commonly used</li>
  <li>Suggest improvements to make the password more secure</li>
</ul>

# Conclusion

The Password Strength Checker is a practical introduction to cybersecurity and secure authentication practices.
It reinforces the importance of creating strong passwords, provides real-time feedback, and demonstrates how weak credentials can compromise security.

This project lays the foundation for more advanced topics like password hashing, brute-force protection, and multi-factor authentication.
